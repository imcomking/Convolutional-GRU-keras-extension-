# Convolutional-GRU-keras-extension-
This is based on keras version='0.2.0'

Hello.

I was trying to build a Convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (ConvGRU).

But few days ago, the keras made a big update to cover the tensorflow backend. (0.2 -> 0.3)

And there ware too huge changes, so I can't follow these by myself. 

So I upload my all dirty source code. But it is really working.

Anybody who are interested in ConvGRU, Please do contribute.

Thank you.
